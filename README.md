# React_Movie_App_Kels
for windows

It's an app that displays list of movies and a list of genres based on data fetched from the api. CRUD functionality for movie is 
supported and it also supports movie filtration based on genre, sorting of movies based on any column header for the table and has 
pagination implemented as well. User registration and user login will be supported as well upon completion.

Working mainly in the "start" folder. The "vidly" folder is the frontend built using React and the "vidly-api-node" 
folder is the backend code for the "vidly" frontend. The other folders are for practice and details will be added upon completion.
